Full Roadmap (We’ll Go One by One)

Now that the base is confirmed, we’ll explore all LangChain core features, one at a time (each with working code for your version).

Step	Feature	Description
✅ 1	LLM Basic Usage	Direct prompt → response
2	PromptTemplate	Parameterized, reusable prompts
3	Chain	Combine multiple steps (prompt → LLM → output parser)
4	Memory	Context retention for multi-turn conversations
5	Tool / Function Calling	Let the LLM use Python tools dynamically
6	Agents	LLMs that decide which tool to use automatically
7	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)	Use your documents + embeddings for context
8	Custom Chat App Integration	Real project example (like your FastAPI or Flask chatbot)
